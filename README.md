This repository contains the LaTeX source for my mathematics thesis, in which I develop a unified, symmetry-based approach to geodesic analysis on curved surfaces and in Schwarzschild spacetime.

## Overview

- **Title:** A Look at Geodesics through the Lens of Symmetries and Its Applications to Black Holes  
- **Author:** Ulizes Raudales  

In this work you will find:  
1. **Differential-geometric foundations** (manifolds, metrics, Christoffel symbols)  
2. **Geodesic equations** on arbitrary surfaces and surfaces of revolution  
3. **Clairaut’s relation** via Killing vector fields and Noether’s theorem  
4. **Applications to Schwarzschild spacetime**: effective potentials, circular orbits, and the photon sphere
